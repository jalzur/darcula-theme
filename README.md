## Contribution
It's very easy to make contributions for this project. You can follow the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme#test-a-new-color-theme) to learn more details, but to keep it short you can do this:
* Fork this project and clone to your computer.
* Open the project on Visual Studio Code.
  * If this theme is installed, disable it before following the next steps.
* Press F5 to start the `Extension Development Host` mode.
* On the development host make sure this theme is selected.
* Open a folder or a file to preview the changes you will make.
* Open the `themes/darcula.color-theme.json` where you can see the many `tokenColors` rules.
* Add new rules to improve this theme.
* Try to keep them sorted in ascending order: `ctrl + shit + p` + `Sort Lines Ascending`.
* Submit a PR.

In order to identify the `scope` of a token, first go to the file that you are using as reference. Then press `ctrl + shit + p`, search and execute `Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes`. Now click on the token that you wish to customize and the inspector will show you the scopes related to that token.

## Credits
* The editor colors were based on [rokoroku/vscode-theme-darcula](https://github.com/rokoroku/vscode-theme-darcula) theme, and changed a little in order to become more like IntelliJ's.
* The token colors were made from scratch and based on IntelliJ IDEA.
